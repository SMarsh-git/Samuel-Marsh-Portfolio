        <br>
        <p>
            My name is Samuel Marsh, I am a junior programmer from Widnes. In 2019, I graduated from the University of York in Politics with International Relations. In late 2021 after leaving my job I have shifted my focus upon working in coding and development. I aim to become competent and proficient in multiple languages. I would love to be able to create various applications, websites, and programs. Ultimately I feel that being a developer is a perfect fit for me. While it is challenging, that means I get to put to use my problem solving skills, my creativity, and my love for cooperative work enviroments to reach satisftying goals.
